# Guess RGB Color Game #
* Welcome to the Guess RGB Color Game! This is a fun and interactive web-based game designed to test your knowledge and intuition about RGB color values. The game presents you with a random RGB color value and challenges you to guess which colored square matches that value.

### How to Play
- When you load the game, you will see several colored squares and an RGB color value displayed at the top.
- Your task is to guess which square matches the displayed RGB value.
- Click on a square to make your guess.
- If you guess correctly, all squares and the header will change to the color you chose, and a message will display confirming your correct choice.
- If you guess incorrectly, the square you clicked will fade out, and you can continue guessing.
- You can choose between difficulty levels.
### Technical Details
- The game is implemented in HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
- It dynamically generates RGB colors and applies them to the squares.
- The style.css file (linked in the HTML) contains the styling.
- JavaScript is used to handle the game logic, events, and DOM manipulations.
### Setup and Launch
- To play the game, simply open the GuessRGBColorGame.html file in a web browser. No additional setup is required.
# Personal Enhancements #
* While this project was initially an instructor-guided project from a Coursera course, I have made several personal enhancements to the original code and design. These modifications reflect my individual learning and creativity, and they distinguish this project from the original course template.
### Note on Code Quality
- Please note that while I have strived to implement best practices, there may be minor inconsistencies or areas for improvement in the code. These do not detract from the overall functionality of the game but are areas I aim to refine as I continue to develop my coding skills.
